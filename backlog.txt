- Setup renderer
- create lib to render primitive meshes (sphere and column)

- create a sceneState object and render with it
  - use sphere and column for vertices and edges
- create methods to setup a scenestate (the methods used in script)
  - v(), c(), vector(), color()
- have script be called on each change to setup new scenestate.  If valid and different from current scenestate then set as current

- add a statusbar lib
	- 2 parts: left=error, right=hovered point location and label
- if script is bad, show error in status bar and set its color

- look into opening and saving in client js
- setup menu
	- file: new, open..., save, save as..., exit
	- demos
		- box
		- sphere
		- face
